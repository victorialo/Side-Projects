A little portfolio of some coding I've done. 

Dash Society
----------------
[Current site](http://dashsociety.com)

Profile pages for the users, horses, and clubs in the Dash Society equine "sim" game written with CSS, HTML, PHP, and MySQL. Written while I was co-owner, with the other co-owner of Dash Society during Fall 2012.

Google Play Rankings
---------------
A Python script using the urllib2, Beautiful Soup 4, and requests libraries to pull the top 540 ranking apps for the "Paid Top-Selling" and "Free Top-Selling" categories on Google Play. Separates by category and outputs in the form "[free, paid], [Google Play ID], [rank number]". See example output in folder.

Image Puller
---------------
Simple little Python script using urllib2 to download images from a directory and rename them upon saving. Came upon this problem when I tried to download a directory using wget but was denied permission via 404, so I wrote my own solution so that I didn't have to download 347 images by hand from a flash gallery.
